## How to play
The game is played on a three-by-three (3x3) square grid of blank spaces where the cards will be placed. Each card has four numbers (known as ranks) placed in top left corner; each number corresponds to one of the four sides of the card. The ranks range from one to nine, the letter A representing ten and the letter S representing eleven. The top right of the card sometimes has an elemental symbol representing the card's element: Earth, Fire, Water, Poison, Holy, Lightning, Wind, or Ice. Pink cards belong to one player and blue cards belong to the other player.

In a basic game each player has five cards. A coin-flip decides who begins. The player who wins the coin toss may choose a card to play anywhere on the grid, or to go second. After the first card is played, their opponent may play a card on any unoccupied space on the board. The game continues with players' turns alternating. 

To win, a majority of the total ten cards played (including the one card that is not placed on the board) must be of the player's card color. To capture a card, the active player places a card adjacent to the opponent's card. If the rank touching the opponent's card is higher, the opponent's card will be captured and flipped into the active player's color. A card can be placed on any open spot on the board. The player who goes second will have a card remaining in their hand and that card will count towards their ending score. Each player may play one card per turn.

A draw occurs if at the end the player and the opponent possess equal numbers of cards in their color. Depending on alternate card rules, this can be defined by a sudden death scenario where the game continues until a winner is defined.
